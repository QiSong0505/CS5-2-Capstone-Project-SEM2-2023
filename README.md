### **Project Title:**
Development of mobile application on pesticide safety and handing for Cambodian farmers.

### **Project Description and Scope:**
Optimising rice productivity is one of the key determinants in achieving future food security as rice is 
a major staple food and currently feeds more than three billion people, most of whom are from 
developing countries where population growth is most rapid. Cambodia is a developing nation, with 
the northwest region known as the “rice bowl of Cambodia” due to its high soil fertility and 
productivity. Pests (insects, diseases, and weeds) are present in all of these lowland rice-growing 
areas which can result in substantial yield losses. Chemical control is by far the most commonly 
adopted practice to manage such pests; however, in Northwest Cambodia pesticides are often 
misused by farmers and sprayers, which can lead to accidental pesticide poisoning, illnesses, and 
even death.
This project aims to develop a mobile application that incorporates evidence-based research 
collected in Northwest Cambodia to promote safe working practices when applying chemical 
pesticides. This will be achieved by integrating a temporal framework of pesticide use into an app to 
assist farmers in making informed decisions at every stage of the decision-making process. This will 
help reduce the risk of pesticide exposure and ensure farmers and their communities are kept safe.

### **Expected outcomes/deliverables:**
Prototype of a mobile application.
